While not all of us can be Marvin Gaye of the party but still making a few friends always helps in life be that for not eating alone at a restaurant or for having a shoulder to rely on during hard times. The big question is how to win over people so that they trust you and you learn to trust them too. But if you are willing to get out of your comforter, maybe you are quite ready to learn the art of making friends. Here are a few tips that may come handy:

`1.` **Join Clubs/Society/Committee/:** It’s easier to make friends with like minded people. Find what kind of interests you have developed over the years and look for the clubs that will quench your interest too. It can be a relaxing book reading club or an enthusiastic sports club. Whatever you choose, chances are that other people who have joined the club must have the same interest. These are the places where you will get to interact with other homo sapiens and interaction is the first step to making friends.

`2.` **Initiate a Conversation:** A conversation can be as lame as *“How’s the weather?”* or as interesting as *“What if Daenerys is made the Queen of 7 kingdoms?”* (#NoSpoilers). Don’t try to hide your true self and be proud of your flaws. This way people will think that you are a confident person while being easygoing. You will not always find people with similar taste or opinion as you but even the differences will help you hold longer conversations or discussions with them.

`3.` **Make time for outings:** Yes, you would rather lie in bed and surf through Instagram pictures of cute cats but will that help you in making friends? We will discuss that later… Point is that making friends need efforts. When you go out with people, it helps you bond. Ask them out for lunch, coffee of maybe for drinks at the pub around the corner. If they have a good time with you, they are more likely to go out with you again and consider you as a good friend.

`4.` **Be good to them:** Qualities like loyalty, trustworthiness, reliability, helpfulness are universally appreciated. If you are trying to be a friend make sure you stress on such qualities because for making a friend you have to be a good friend first. *A Friend in need is a friend indeed.* Any relation works on the basic concept of compromise and friendship is same. Offer your assistance when required. Be the shoulder they can cry on, listen to their mundane stuff, tell them about yours too.

`5.` **Maintain Contact and Stay Touch:** Maintaining contact is not about going out every other day but it feels nice to receive a text from a friend once in while asking "how are you?" or "how’s the day going?". Initiate get-togethers, go to concerts together, meet for lunch or maybe just  pizza night at your house tonight?
