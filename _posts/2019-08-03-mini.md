**"Less stuff means more freedom"**

Do you think you spend too much time on selecting between clothes, what food to eat, what place to hang out at? One solution to this problem can be Minimalism.

You might have heard a lot about it, “But what is minimalism?”. The question of minimalism can be viewed from different angles – from people who follow minimalism that I have known for many years. I came up with a short and simple answer: “It is to live with things that you truly need.”. It is about saving the time to think between the options, save money and simply breathe.

## Minimalism is to lose the desire to possess more.

Modern culture has bought into the lie that the good life is found in accumulating things—in possessing as much as possible. They believe that more is better and have inadvertently subscribed to the idea that happiness can be purchased at a department store.

## Is it achievable? Yes!

Minimalism can be easily achieved. It is not that hard. All you have to do is think about what you are going to use for a good time before buying it, Understand what things are important to you and what is not. It can save a hell lot of money. Buy good quality stuff that you can use for a long time. 

## How to start? Your wardrobe!

+ **Be Picky!!!**  
Train yourself to become more selective is single most effective thing you can do to upgrade your wardrobe. Try to think of your wardrobe as an exclusive society meeting, members-only. the Only clothes that you love and are truly excited to wear get an invite. Give away anything ill-fitting, scratchy, worn-out, barely "good enough," or that simply doesn't suit your personal style is not invited.

+ **Be authentic: you are unique, just like everyone else in this world!**
Get your clothes tailored. The problem with ready-made is, one-size-fits-all approach can give you only a ready-made, one-size-fits-all wardrobe. Following rules and blueprints are not going to help you cultivate a strong sense of style, because your personal style is just that: deeply personal.

+ **Aim for high quality: buy clothes that you can wear for years!**
Getting high-quality clothes will save your time to buy them again and again, at some time you will be saving a lot of money.

### In simple words: Don't buy anything, Don't do anything, Don't be with anyone... that you don't love!

It can be applied to everything, it is about a lifestyle that you blend in.. Cons of this lifestyle can be becoming too vanilla and bored with your daily routine, some might say it makes a person unwelcoming and cold.
